            <h2>My Web Development Story</h2>
            <p>When I just being an Informatics Engineering Student in Gunadarma University, I do not know much about Programming or Coding. But then I introduced my first programming language, Java. Java gave me some glimpse how Programming and Coding looks like, how I feel when I put my codes and the syntax into the screen, and got the first satisfaction after running the program and it works</p>

            <p>However, from day to day I felt like I wanted to know how I can applicate this in real life? What this Programming can do or make real life result? So I decided to search some Programmers portfolio and their awesome works, I also found out that one of my friends already made his own Web Projects. So, I asked him how he did it, what tools he used, and where he learned that skill</p>

            <p>Before I learned from online courses such as Codepolitan and Udemy, I watched some YouTube tutorials about Web Development, including "1 Hour HTML, CSS, and JS Programming" by freeCodeCamp. But I still got struggled to make my own website, so I decided to take courses and I can make my own Portfolio. And then I decided to learn back about JavaScript, and it was difficult for me then I did not coding for about 2 months. And currently, I am on online course in Udemy to strengthen my knowledge and built my motivation to hone my Web Skill back.</p>

            <h2>My Mission and Goal</h2>
            <p>From making this portfolio, I set up my mission and my goal to achieve through Web Programming. My mission is I can built website from for my own, to my family, my friend, my community, and for everyone else in the world. My goal is I can achieve good reputation, good high salary, and my skill can be useful for many people.</p>
