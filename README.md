# Capstone-Resumeüìù
## Welcome to my Capstone Repository, in this repo I built Resume Portfolio website only using HTML and a little bit CSS

- What this repository contains?
It contains my Capstone Resume Website for my Udemy Online Course Project

- Why you made this project?
Because from this project I can take my first step to build my own website and share it to everyone else so they can visit it.

- What did you learn?
I learned that making website is not always looking at tutorials or course, you have to take step to build your own, facing the confusion, the struggle, thinking the logic, and get some resources to rich your website.

- How I can use this repo for my own?
If you are a beginner that just started to learn Web Development and already through HTML and Introduction of CSS, you can use this portfolio as your reference. You can Fork this Project and then clone with Git to you computer using ``` git clone ``` command.
